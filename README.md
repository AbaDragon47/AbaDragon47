# Hey, its Aba! 👋

Video games 🎮 and milk tea 🧋 are my two true loves, but I’m also always on the hunt for new things to learn and discover 🔎. Currently an undergrad at the University of Texas at Dallas 📚. Some of the stuff you see here is a work-in-progress (aka something I accidentally broke 🤦‍♂️), but hey, there’s some cool stuff too! Check it out! 😅
